          <h2> reasoning for my ranking </h2>
          <h3> listed in same order as above </h3>
          <ul>
            <li> i put michigan at number one because they are the best program in college football history.</li>
            <li>gEORGIA gOES number two because they won the naty last year and theyve won multiple naty's in previous years .</li>
            <li>i put alabama as 3 because they have one of the best copaches who knows how to organize team but still not better than michigan or georgia .</li>
            <li> Ohio state goes at fourth because they are a decent football program , just not good enough to be in top 3 .</li>
            <li> I put oregan at 5 because they are a good program + they have good uniforms , but they just arent as good as the top 4 teams . </li>
          </ul>
